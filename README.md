# Face Recognition Using PCA
Implementation of PCA in Python for recognizing Faces(Internship Studio):
1. Single Person Image
2. Group Image
3. Recognize Face In Video
# Requirements
1. numpy
2. opencv
3. scipy
# Usage
1. In Face_Recognition class use algo_type from (PCA)
2. In Face_Recognition class use reco_type as
  - for single image = 0
  - for video = 1
  - for group image = 2
3. You can put your dataset in the images folder and change the name of the dataset in the dataset.py file
4. Run Face_Recognition.
